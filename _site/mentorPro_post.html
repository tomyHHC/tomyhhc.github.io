<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The business I’m affiliated with is E.D.G.e Mentorship program and it’s power by <a href="https://www.amway.com/about-amway/yagergroup">The Yager Group</a>. The Yager Group is an independent Amway approved training provider. Their mentoring and training system has established a proven history of helping indivitual build their own successful business. The Yagers Group’s passion has always been to help people who want to help themselves in a business of their own. By helping people develop a good self-image and a strong self-confidence, the Yager Group has inspired tens of thousands to unleash their full potential.</p>

<p>Amway Global is the number-one direct selling business on the planet, raking in around $9 billion a year. Harvard Business School, which described Amway as “one of the most profitable direct selling companies in the world”. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway">Amway Wiki</a>]</p>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<p>I know the introduction may not touch your heart, same result as I share with most people. Why? Because people have not found their WHY to do it. Because a new idea clashing with the way they think. Because it’s easier to reject than to learn. “That system does not work.” “It’s impossible to earn money.” “It causes money and time.” “Direct Selling is bad.” “[Silence with embarrassing smile…]” Some argue instead of asking questions. Some never ask questions. Then I have questions. <i>“How do you know it doesn’t work?” “Have you done any research or tried it by yourself?” “Or are you allowing other people’s thoughts to block your way to a new better life level?”</i> <b>I am always shocked at people who search changes in their lives, but keep doing same things expecting different outcomes and never invest in their greatest asset, their mind. A truly intelligent person welcomes, listens, and talks about new ideas in order to grasp opportunities to achieve his/her goals and dreams.</b></p>

<p>Have you read one of my favorite books, <b>Rich Dad Poor Dad</b> by Robert Kiyosaki, which improves my Financial IQ and changes my whole perspective of money? If not, <b>I sincerely encourage you to read this book</b>. It will change the way you think, and maybe change your whole life! If you have, AWESOME! You may know how important the knowledge I’m going to share with you! <img class="emoji" title=":thumbsup:" alt=":thumbsup:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44d.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>Most people, after age 18, apply jobs and go to work for incomes. When they run out of money, they work harder in order to solve money problems. <i>Have you ever thought about what is wrong with it? Why should you do it in that way? If you get sick or for some reasons that you cannot work, how do you make money? Is there another way that maybe eaiser, or at least you can have choices to do what you like or love and have freedom?</i> <b>The Rich Dad called it “The Rat Race”, which keeps people inside this trap, work more and harder, and pay more taxes because they are lack of knowledge since no one taught them financial education, even schools.</b> <img class="emoji" title=":disappointed_relieved:" alt=":disappointed_relieved:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f625.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<h3 id="cash-flow-quadrant">Cash Flow Quadrant</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/amwayFF/cash-flow-quadrant.jpg" alt="cash-flow-quadrant">
E is what most people are doing and where we all start from. Some professional jobs, like lawyers or doctors, are S who earn higher incomes. Do you know what? Their net income are not neccessariy higher than yours for they’re paying more liabilities and taxes. They are still in the Rat Race.</p>

<p>On the other side, people in the B &amp; I quadrant know how to play the game. They invest on assets instead of liabilities in order to gain passive income. <b>B &amp; I are the places giving them time, money, and financial freedom. The poor and the middle class work for money; the rich have money work for them.</b> These are just few concepts I share from “Rich Dad Poor Dad”. Are you interested now? <img class="emoji" title=":smirk:" alt=":smirk:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f60f.png" height="20" width="20"> <img class="emoji" title=":grin:" alt=":grin:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f601.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p><b>The more people I get to know, the more disapointment I have for they have not been taught any solid financial knowledge. Many people struggling with money but don’t know what problems they have and how to do with those problems. They work harder to earn money for a short term supply. Then what? They work even harder when running out money, and don’t know they are losing treasures of life, Time &amp; Health &amp; Happiness.</b> How sad is that!? <img class="emoji" title=":sob:" alt=":sob:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f62d.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>If you know me well, you may know I’m a person with a lot of love, sincerity, righteousness, passion about serving and helping people. <b>Knowledge is power if knowing how to use.</b> I’m even planning to have a education business in the future in order to make people’s lives better and change the world. That’s why I typed so much on WHY and want to help as many people as I can to gain happiness and peace through changes and success! They just don’t have a map to success…and do you start to see your WHY?</p>

<p>Now the opportunity is in front of you and you decide it. If you desire, don’t let it pass. <b>You will be required to learn a lot, changing your mindset, ways you think and habits, in order to become stronger in mind and spirit to achieve success. You reap what you sow. You become what you do.</b> I would love to talk to you first and see what I can help for you to prepare yourself for this business and see if you fit this business or not. It is not just about money but also learning and growing; If you are not interested, that’s totally ok. Maybe it doesn’t fit you. <b>I encourage you to share these important knowledge with your family and friends and keep searching ways to get to B &amp; I quadrant. May the Lord bless you with success!</b> <img class="emoji" title=":innocent:" alt=":innocent:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f607.png" height="20" width="20"></p>
